                    <h4>The Mating Game</h4>
                    <p>An active-learning exercise in which students can enact Mendel’s fundamental laws of genetics to create their own (simulated) populations in which alternative alleles segregate and then assort to yield the canonical 3:1 and 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratios (or not!)</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SingleLocus(example).jpg" alt="Single Locus example worksheet" width="188" height="252" hspace="20" align="left" /><p><strong>The Single Locus Version</strong><br />
                  This introductory rendition of The Mating Game allows students to explore Mendel’s Law of Segregation to understand the means by which underlying allelic genotypes configurations  yield alternative phenotypic outcomes.</p>

                    <div><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/TwoLocus(example).jpg" alt="Two Locus example worksheet" hspace="20" align="left" /><p><strong>The Two Locus Version</strong><br />
                  This advanced rendition of The Mating Game allows students to explore Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment and perhaps come to recognize that his second Law is merely an extension of his first Law of Genetics as applied to more than a single locus-- until that beautiful hypothesis was slain by the ugly facts of nature (think: linkage).</p></div>
